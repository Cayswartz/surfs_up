## Overview of Statistical Analysis
In this assignment we are looking into opening a surf shop that also serves ice cream. While this may be a great business plan for when the weather is sunny one of our potential investors, W. Avy, is concerned about the weather and seasonality of this business. We are diving into some weather trends for the Island of Oahu to hopefully show that even this is a great business!

## Results
1. The min temperature for the month of December is about 8 degrees less than in June
2. The mean temperatuve for June, at 74.9, is slightly higher than the mean temperature in December, which sits at 71.
3. The max temperature in December is 83 while the max temperature in June is 85



## Summary
Overall, it seems that the weather patterns don't very too much between December and June. While December is slighlty colder the mean temperature only sits about 3 degrees apart from each other. This shows that regardless of the month people will likely be interested in ice cream and surfing. 

To further the analysis, I would like to take a closer look at the rain patterns. While the weather may be nice, rain could put a damper on people's desire for ice cream and less people will definitely be drawn to the beach to surf. I would also look at. I would also take a closer look at the weather station and how the temperature and rain patterns vary from station to station. It would be important to refine my data to stations near the beaches around my location as well as my own locations.
